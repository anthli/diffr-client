### Introduction
Many have used (or will use) a diff tool at some point in their life as
a developer. However, not everyone asks themselves "how does it really work?".

This project started from wanting to learn what really happens behind the scenes
when running the command `git diff`. While not intended to be a clone, this
project serves as a learning experience into what constructs a diff.
